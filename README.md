# Recipe Application

This project is a simple console application that allows users to add, delete, and update recipes.

## About the Project

This application comprises a `Recipe` class and a `RecipeDatabase` class. The `Recipe` class represents a recipe and includes fields for the recipe name, ingredients list, and instructions. The `RecipeDatabase` class contains a list of recipes and provides functions for adding, deleting, and updating recipes.

## Usage

The application presents a menu to the user and waits for them to enter an option. When the user enters an option (e.g., choosing to add a recipe by selecting "1"), the program performs the relevant operation and then displays the menu again. This loop continues until the user selects "5" to exit the program.

## Features

- Adding recipes
- Deleting recipes
- Updating recipes
- Viewing all recipes

## Development

This project can be used as a starting point and can be extended to create a more complex recipe application. Additional features such as a database or a user interface can be added.
